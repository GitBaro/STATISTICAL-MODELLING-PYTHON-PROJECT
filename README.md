# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
The objective of the project is to make statistical analysis and models based on the data of bike stations in the city of Dublin, Ireland

## Process
### Requesting data from the citybikes api and creating DataFrame(s) based on the bike stations in the city of Dublin, Ireland
### Using Yelp and Foursquare api's to request and find data on places and their points of interest as related to the bike stations
### Merging data from citybikes results and Yelp/Foursquare results, finding insights based on such
### Loading the data into a SQLite3 Database 
### Making visualizations and building a statistical model to explain the relationships between bike stations information and points of interest information for different places


## Results
-Yelp api offers fuller data when it comes to points of interest, such as ratings, rating counts, prices, etc.

-There werent very powerful relationships in the model.

## Challenges 
-Figuring out how to join the citybikes and yelp/foursquare api data

-Pulling the proper data from the apis


## Future Goals
-Trying to find more relevant informatioin, perhaps from diffirent api's to get fuller data

-Running more statistical models and analysis to see more clear relationships
